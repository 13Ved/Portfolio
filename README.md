## Projects

### News Classification Using NLP & LSTM 
•	Developed a comprehensive machine learning system to classify images of five sports celebrities, showcasing the end to-end process from data collection to deployment.  <br>
•	Utilized Selenium for Python to scrape and gather images from Getty Images. Applied advanced image processing techniques, including face and eyes detection with OpenCV, to clean and
prepare the data for model training.  <br>
•	Trained multiple classifiers, including SVM, logistic regression, and random forest. Achieved a 70% accuracy with the SVM model, demonstrating effective classification performance.  <br>
•	Enhanced model accuracy using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Deployed the final model via a Streamlit application, providing a real-time interface for image classification.  <br>
Software used Python, Streamlit

### Sports Celebrity Image Classification
•	Built an LSTM model to sort news articles into categories like World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology, making classification more accurate.  <br>
•	Cleaned and prepared the AG News dataset using Natural Language Processing to normalize text and remove extraneous words for effective model training.  <br>
•	Improved the model's accuracy using methods like tuning settings and cross-validation, and avoided overfitting to get reliable results.  <br>
Software used Python, Streamlit

### Salary Prediction Webpage
•	Analysed Stack Overflow survey data to forecast employee salaries with a focus on financial metrics and used machine learning model such as Decision Tree Regression to predict salaries. <br>
•	Developed an interactive web app with Streamlit and Python for users to input financial data, such as compensation and purchase influence, for personalized salary forecasts. <br>
•	Employed Python for financial modeling and Streamlit for a user- friendly prediction interface <br>
Software used: Python, Streamlit

### Weather Prediction Webpage
• Developed a Weather application using Flask, HTML, and Python. <br>
• Implemented a Random Forest classifier to analyze weather patterns and predict conditions based on historical data. <br>
• Utilized Flask for backend development, HTML for front-end interface, and Python libraries for data processing. <br>
Software used: Python, Streamlit

### Survival Analysis of an Employee and Churn Prediction
•	Using parametric and non-parametric approaches to find out the survival rates of an em-ployee in a company (K-M estimator) <br>
•	Using Cox regression to estimate the hazard rate and find out the factors for attrition <br>
•	Using Logistic Regression to model the attrition of employees in the company <br>
